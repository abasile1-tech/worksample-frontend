# Frontend Worksample

This repository contains everything you will need to create your worksample when applying as a frontend developer at Odd Hill.

## What you will be building

You will be creating markup and styling for a fictional community for books. The website lets users rate, review and search books and much more.

## Expectations

We expect you to build everything from the ground up. You are NOT allowed to use any frameworks like Boostrap or Tailwind CSS.

You are expected to build at least one of the pages in the design with responsive styling. You may exclude certain parts of the page if you dont have the time to complete them all.

You are allowed to use a bundler like Webpack, Parcel or otherwise to build the worksample but it's not a requirement.

The project should be built with HTML and CSS or SCSS.

You are expected to built the project with components in mind and you should follow the [BEM](http://getbem.com/) way of naming classes.

The final work sample should include a readme on how to get the project up and running and what requirements that must be met.

You are not expected to include any JavaScript but if you want to make the menu interactive you may include JavaScript but avoid using frameworks like jQuery and instead focus on writing Vanilla JavaScript.

## The design

The design for the worksample is hosted on Figma and you may view it by going to the following link.

## If you have time

If you have the time you may build at least one of the pages in the design with a JavaScript framework. Since we mostly work with React we would prefer it if you also build it with React.

## If you have even more time

If you have even more time build all of the pages in a JavaScript framework and build some of the interactive elements like the rating.
